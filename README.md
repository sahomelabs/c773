# Project Summary: Paradigm Pet Professionals Website Redesign
Key Objectives
The main objective was to give an outdated website a fresh and modern look while making it user-friendly for prospective and current pet owners. I aimed to build a platform that not only highlighted the expertise of Paradigm Pet Professionals but also genuinely addressed the needs of its users.

# Development Process
I referred to the “Paradigm Pet Professionals UI Design Specifications” to gain insights into the necessary features and content for the redesign, ensuring that the new website effectively meets bboth stakeholder and user needs.

Design Prototypes: I created interactive desktop prototypes for several important sections:

Home Page: I focused on designing a warm and welcoming layout that highlighted services, showcased testimonials, and made it easy for users to schedule consultations. The homepage was intended to feel inviting and reassuring for anyone seeking assistance.

Dog Owners Page: This section was dedicated to dog owners and filled with useful resources and practical tips that I knew would be valuable for dog lovers like myself.

Cat Owners Page: I developed a dedicated area for cat owners, ensuring it was packed with relevant information and easy to navigate.

New Persona Page: I introduced the Bird Page as a new persona. This section is designed to be a vibrant hub for bird owners, filled with insights and resources.

Contact Form: I designed a simple and inviting contact form to facilitate user requests for virtual consultations. It includes essential fields like name, email, pet type, pet’s name, and pet's age, preferred consultation date/time, and comments, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

Navigation and Positional Awareness: To make navigation as intuitive as possible, I implemented a clear structure that guides users through the site. I utilized techniques like breadcrumbs and highlighted menu items to enhance positional awareness, helping users know where they were at all times. I believe this greatly enhances the overall user experience.



# TNM1 — Task 2: Multipage Website Prototype
Introduction
User interface and user experience (UI/UX) designer is one of the most popular job titles in the technology industry. UI/UX designers tend to enjoy the challenges associated with creating products that people love. Industry leaders know that design is a substantial competitive advantage and they are competing for best talents; therefore, the demand for designers is high. UI/UX design requires an understanding of core design principles, tools, and best practices. Having foundational principles of design enables you to create an effective user experience.

This task allows you to showcase your prototyping skills by using the appropriate tools and techniques to communicate your design ideas and solutions. You will create and submit an interactive desktop prototype based on the attached “Paradigm Pet Professionals UI Design Specifications.” Your prototype must address both audience and stakeholder needs. Your work for Task 2 will not be evaluated until Task 1 has been submitted and passed.
Scenario
You were recently hired as a UI/UX Designer for Synesthor, an IT services company that offers on-site consultation for small businesses without an IT department. Synesthor recently contracted with Paradigm Pet Professionals, a company that specializes in providing virtual consultations with pet owners based on state-of-the-art, evidence-based health and well-being information. Its website was designed by a part-time intern 10 years ago. Most people who visit the website are prospective and new pet owners located in the United States who seek information about basic pet care and are interested in speaking with a consultant. Paradigm Pet Professionals contracted with Synesthor’s UI/UX department to develop a responsive website to meet the needs of its company and its existing and potential users.

Having completed your evaluation of the existing “Paradigm Pet Professionals Website” in Task 1, you will now create an interactive desktop prototype of the redeveloped website according to the design specifications provided by Paradigm Pet Professionals.
Requirements
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The similarity report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide.

 

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

 

Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).

 

A.  Create an interactive desktop prototype based on the audience and stakeholder needs using the attached “Paradigm Pet Professional UI Design Specifications” by doing the following:

1.  Include each of the redeveloped “Home,” “Dog Owners,” and “Cat Owners” design prototypes, using content for each corresponding persona from the attached “Paradigm Pet Professionals UI Design Specifications.”

2.  Include one new design prototype based on one of the new user personas, including the content provided and the format specified in the attached “Paradigm Pet Professionals UI Design Specifications.”

3.  Include a contact form that users can complete to request a virtual consultation with a pet professional that includes all the required fields specified in the attached “Paradigm Pet Professionals UI Design Specifications.”

Note: Your prototype should show the fields that will appear on your contact form, but the contact form does not need to be functional.

4.  Include primary and secondary navigation elements as well as positional awareness techniques that provide the ability to clearly identify where each page is located within the overall information architecture and that allow users to navigate and interact between all sections of the website. 

B.  Provide a .pptx file or compressed .html file of your interactive desktop prototype, including the following:

•  the updated “Home,” “Dog Owners,” and “Cat Owners” design prototypes

•  the new design prototype

•  the virtual consultation form

 

Note: You can use any tool to create the design prototypes, such as a graphic creation/manipulation software, webpage creation software, presentation software or another tool of your choice.

 

C.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
